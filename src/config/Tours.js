The walk will cover a total of approximately 75 miles. Take time to reflect, contemplate, meditate, and give this challenge the meaning you prefer, whether spiritual, religious, physical, or just an opportunity to meet like-minded people. After landing in Porto, start your journey by walking across the Portuguese-Spanish border on the bridge over the Minho river. Drive to the coastal town of Baiona and walk the Portuguese Way",
